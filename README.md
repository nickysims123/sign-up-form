# sign-up-form
Here's my take on the sign-up form project from TheOdinProject curriculum! This form will
input a user's first and last name, email, phone number, password (with confirmation),
and validate necessary fields. Once the form is submitted JS will be used to display
it on a VERY rudimentary page to verify it's worked.
